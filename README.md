Sample Data Sets can be found here: 
https://codesandbox.io/s/fake-data-um30v?file=/src/index.js 

1. As per above data set, create new user object with the same properties as dataset and insert it at the end of the array. 
2. As per above data set, create new user object with the same properties as dataset and insert it into a random index in the users array using splice() method. 
3. As per above data set, create new users array from given users array and select only users between 2nd index to 5th index. 
4. As per above data set, we want to find all the rooms of a user named Amanda Smith. 
● First, find the user in users array with the name Amanda Smith, you will find the id of the user. 
● Then, filter all the rooms for which room.custom.room_creator_id is equal to the id of Amanda Smith.


Assignment 3

Sample endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts 

Using the above sample endpoint, make a function that would "log an object" with the number of posts of each individual user.
Example: { user1: 6, user2: 10,...,user10: 3 }
use: .then .catch

Assignment 4

Write a program that loops from 1 to 99 and logs: 
i) “TWO” if the number is a multiple of 2 OR  
ii) “FIVE” if it’s a multiple of 5 OR 
iii) “BOTH” if it’s a multiple of both 2 and 5
iv) If it’s none of the above, log the number as it is.
(A multiple of a 2 means a number that is divisible by 2, eg: 2, 4, 6, …)


Assignment 5

Make a function that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the string in reverse.
Eg: “Hello” will be returned as “olleH”
Note: Use builtin methods

"09:13:14"
and so on

Assignment 8

Write a function to sort the following array of objects by id value.

var sampleArray = [ 
      { name: 'Bashir Butt', title: 'Learn Programming', id: 6721},
      { name: 'Sebastian Rao', title: 'Next Door', id: 1423},

       name: 'Bashir Butt', 
       title: 'Learn Programming', 
       id: 6721 
}

Sample Output: ['name', 'title', 'id'] and ['Bashir Butt', 'Learn Programming', 6721]

Assignment 10

Write a function to convert an object into an array of `[key, value]` pairs

var sampleObject = { 
       name: 'Bashir Butt', 
       title: 'Learn Programming', 
       id: 6721 
}

Sample Output: [ ['name', 'Bashir Butt'], ['title', 'Learn Programming'], ['id', 6721] ]
